CST Station is a city within a city—bustling, chaotic, and full of stories. On a particularly crowded morning, I managed to lose my bag somewhere between platform 7 and the vada pav stall. Panic set in as I retraced my steps, dodging commuters and pigeons.

## I asked a policeman for help.

He shrugged, “Lost bags are like lost dreams here, sahib. Sometimes they come back, sometimes they don’t.” Not exactly reassuring.

Determined, I began my search. I questioned vendors, fellow passengers, and even a group of school kids who looked suspiciously innocent. No luck. Just as I was about to give up, a voice called out, “Bhaiya, yeh aapka bag hai?”

It was a little girl, no older than eight, holding my bag like a trophy. Her mother explained that they’d found it near the ticket counter and were looking for its owner. I thanked them profusely, offering to buy the girl a treat. She chose a bright orange ice lolly, her smile as wide as the station itself.

As I left CST, bag in hand and heart a little lighter, I realized that in Mumbai, what’s lost is often found in the most unexpected ways. Sometimes, all it takes is a little kindness—and a lot of luck.
