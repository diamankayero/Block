If you want to understand Mumbai, take a ride on its local trains. My daily commute from Borivali to Churchgate is usually a test of patience, balance, and the ability to ignore armpits.

## But one Thursday, the train had other plans.

It started with a group of college students, armed with dholaks and a questionable sense of rhythm. They launched into a medley of Bollywood hits, their enthusiasm drowning out the train’s usual clatter. Soon, the entire compartment was clapping along, even the grumpy uncle who never smiles.

At Dadar, a street magician hopped on. He pulled coins from behind ears, made handkerchiefs disappear, and even convinced a skeptical aunty that her bindi had magical powers. Laughter bounced off the metal walls, and for a moment, the train felt like a traveling circus.

Then came the snack vendors, weaving through the crowd with trays of samosas and chai. One vendor, seeing the festive mood, started cracking jokes. “Why did the vada pav cross the tracks? To get to the other platform!” Groans and giggles followed.

By the time we reached Churchgate, I realized I hadn’t checked my phone once. The train ride had become a show, and we were all part of the cast. In Mumbai, even the most ordinary journeys can turn extraordinary—with a little laughter and a lot of spirit.
