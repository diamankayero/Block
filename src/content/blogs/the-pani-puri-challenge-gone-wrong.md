It started as a simple dare. My friend Rohan claimed he could eat more pani puris than anyone in Mumbai. Naturally, I accepted the challenge. We met at our favorite stall in Ghatkopar, where the vendor, sensing drama, called over half the neighborhood to watch.

The rules were simple: whoever ate the most pani puris without crying, coughing, or surrendering, won. The first few rounds were easy—crisp puris, spicy water, and lots of bravado. But soon, the spice level increased, and so did the audience’s laughter.

## Rohan’s eyes watered. I hiccupped.

The vendor, now in full showman mode, started narrating our struggle like a cricket commentator. “Aur yeh Samay ka chhata hua chehra! Rohan ki aankhon mein aansu!”

By the tenth puri, my nose was running, and Rohan was fanning his mouth with a napkin. A little kid in the crowd shouted, “Uncle, give up!” But pride is a powerful spice.

Finally, Rohan caved, gasping for water. I tried to celebrate, but the next puri was my undoing. I coughed so hard that the vendor handed me a free sweet puri as consolation.

We both lost, but the crowd cheered anyway. In Mumbai, it’s not about winning or losing—it’s about the stories you collect, one spicy puri at a time.
