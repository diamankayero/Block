Colaba is famous for its cafes, markets, and one very special cat. Her name is Rani, and she’s not your average street cat. With a patchwork coat and a tail that flicks like a conductor’s baton, Rani has the run of the neighborhood—and everyone knows it.

I first met Rani outside a bakery, where she was being served a saucer of milk by the owner himself. “She’s our lucky charm,” he whispered. “Business doubled after she started visiting.”

Rani’s daily routine was a masterclass in Mumbai survival. She’d start at the Irani café for breakfast, nap in the bookstore window, and then patrol the market, accepting treats and head scratches from shopkeepers. Tourists took selfies with her; locals greeted her like royalty.

One day, a new tomcat tried to muscle in on her territory. Rani, unfazed, stared him down with a look that said, “Not today, mister.” The tom slunk away, and the legend of Rani grew.

When the monsoon hit, Rani found shelter in the post office, curling up on a stack of undelivered letters. The postmaster didn’t mind—he said she brought good luck.

In a city that never sleeps, Rani taught us all to slow down, claim our space, and accept treats when offered. She wasn’t just a cat—she was the queen of Colaba, and we were all her loyal subjects.
